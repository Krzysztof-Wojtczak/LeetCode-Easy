"""Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
Example 2:
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        return str(x) == str(x)[::-1]
